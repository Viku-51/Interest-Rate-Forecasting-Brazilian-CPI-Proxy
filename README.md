# Interest-Rate-Forecasting-Brazilian-CPI-Proxy
This project aims to forecast the Brazilian interest rate trend using CPI data as a proxy. It applies time series modeling techniques, primarily using the ARIMA model, and includes data visualization, stationarity testing, and performance evaluation. 


ðŸ§  Objective 
To demonstrate time series forecasting skills using macroeconomic data relevant to interest rate modeling and financial strategy.

ðŸ“¦ Tools Used

-Python

-Pandas, numpy

-matplotlib, seaborn

-statsmodels (ARIMA)

-scikit-learn (RMSE metric)

Key Tasks

* Data Cleaning & Parsing from a publicly available CPI dataset (filtered for Brazil)

* Visualization & ADF Test for stationarity

* ARIMA(1,1,1) Modeling and parameter tuning

* Forecasting future values and plotting projections

Backtesting using RMSE to measure forecast accuracy
